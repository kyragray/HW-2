```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# Do not edit this code block. By setting cache=TRUE, we are saving the output 
# of this block to the cache. That way it only needs to run once.  This is
# especially useful for portions of code that take a long time to run.

## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with:
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW so far:
* The URL of the RPubs published URL [here](https://www.nhl.com/).
* What gave you the most trouble:
* Any comments you have:



## Question 1:

Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the `profiles` data set,
specifically on the relationship between gender and

* `income`
* `job`
* One more categorical variable of your choice

all keeping in mind in HW-3, you will be fitting a logistic regression to
predict a user's gender based on these variables.

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}

```



## Question 2:

In the file `HW-2_Shiny_App.Rmd`, build the Shiny App discussed in Lec09 on
Monday 10/3: Using the `movies` data set in the `ggplot2movies` data set, make a
Shiny app that

* Plots budget on the x-axis and rating on the y-axis
* Instead of having a radio button to select the genre of movie (`Action`,
`Animation`, `Comedy`, etc), have a radio button that allows you to toggle
between comedies and non-comedies. This app should be simpler.
